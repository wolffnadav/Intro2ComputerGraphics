In this exercise I was implement and explore image resizing using the seam carving algorithm, 
along with other basic image processing operations.
The different operations:
- Changing the image's hue.
- Conversion into grayscale.
- Resizing an image using two methods:
  * Nearest neighbor.
  * Seam carving.
- Object removal using seam carving
