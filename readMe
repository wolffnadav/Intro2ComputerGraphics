Explanation of showSeams method -
    We are initialize boolean 2D array - showSeamMatrix,
    it holds in each point true if this pixel index belongs to some seam or false otherwise.

    1. First we create a new empty image.
    2. Then checking if we need to make reduce(then produce "reduceImageWidth")
        else increase the image (with "increaseImageWidth").
        We are doing this to get all the seams that need to be show.
    3. Then we set the image inputParameters with "setForEachInputParameters".
    4. Then we traverse all over the new image pixels and for all pixels that are in some seam change
        their color to "seamColorRGB" which we get as an input, or else keep the pixel colors as it is.
    5. Finally we return the new image.
